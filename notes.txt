Don't actually make a program with real passwords!
This is just a fun project.

If the user types in the correct password, we will encrypt the other passwords.
Let's dive in.

1. Ask user for the password.
2. Then ask if they want to add or view passwords in the database.
The options that follow will be in a while True loop.
3. Make a function for each of the view and add paths.
4. This is so that we can have the logic in a function, and not all
nested in a loop.
5. For the add function:
    - ask for name and password
    - open up passwords.txt and put the info in
    ** use "with" because the file will automatically close.

    with open('passwords.txt', 'a') as f:

    The second argument is the mode in which we interact with the file.
        - 'w' - write. Override a file if it exists, or create a new one. Only use if you want to override.
        - 'r' - read. All you can do is read. Can't alter it.
        - 'a' - append. Adds something to the end of existing file, or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
